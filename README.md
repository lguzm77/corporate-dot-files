# Corporate dot-files

A minimal version of my dot-files. My personal dot files are full of ricing bloat and personal projects, which impacts my productivity. To address this and encourage a better work-life balance, I decided to create a fork of my dot-files from scratch.

# Project structure.

- setup.sh -> Bootstrap any necessary dependencies
- nvim/ -> personal, minimal neovim configuration. Based on LazyVim :)
- zshrc/ -> personal, minimal z-shell configuration. 

# Setup 

Run `setup.sh` :)
